  "2. Stress and anxiety: Some people may bite their tongue unconsciously when they are feeling stressed or anxious. This may be due to nervousness or tension that can manifest itself in different physical ways.\n" +

  "3. Sleep disorders: Some sleep disorders such as sleep apnea or bruxism (setting teeth) can cause people to bite their own tongue during sleep. If someone bites their tongue frequently during sleep, it may be best to see a doctor or a sleep specialist for further evaluation.";
